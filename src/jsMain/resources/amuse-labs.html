    <h2>Crossword Scraper - Note About Amuse Labs</h2>
    <hr/>
    <p>
        If you are seeing this page, you've encountered a failure scraping an Amuse Labs puzzle. This may be a bug
        specific to this puzzle (in which case, please
        <a href="https://github.com/jpd236/CrosswordScraper/issues">report it</a>), but if it is happening for multiple
        puzzles, this page may provide more context as to a likely cause.
    </p>
    <p>
        Recently, Amuse Labs has begun introducing obfuscation measures to try and prevent automatic extraction of their
        puzzle data. While I believe that Crossword Scraper is friendly to publishers by requiring you to view the page
        hosting a puzzle - including, for example, any advertisements - before downloading a puzzle, the mechanism it
        uses to extract puzzle data can also be used by applications to download puzzles directly, without viewing the
        page. I can only speculate that Amuse Labs is attempting to make such access more difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
        While I would like to keep this tool working for as many sources as possible, I feel it is vital not to
        antagonize crossword publishers. Also, I maintain this tool in my spare time as a fun project, and cannot spend
        significant time and energy keeping up with frequent changes designed explicitly to break tools such as this.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will aim to keep the scraper working for Amuse Labs (and all sources) as long as reasonably possible, but
        please be warned that there may be periods where it is broken as each change can take days to resolve. At some
        point, support for Amuse Labs puzzles may have to be removed altogether.
